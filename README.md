# Portfolio Website Project

Welcome to my Portfolio Website repository!

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website is built using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, combining the power of server-side rendering, component-based architecture, and a utility-first CSS framework.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: I've chosen Next.js for its seamless server-side rendering and routing capabilities, which enhance the website's performance and SEO optimization.

- **React**: The portfolio website is built as a series of reusable React components, allowing for a dynamic and interactive user experience.

- **Tailwind CSS**: I've utilized Tailwind CSS to style the website. Its utility classes streamline the design process while providing flexibility and consistency in the visual presentation.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Project Showcase**: The portfolio showcases a collection of my projects, each with its own description, technologies used, and a link to its live demo or repository.

- **Contact Information**: The contact section provides ways for visitors to get in touch with me, including links to my LinkedIn and email.
